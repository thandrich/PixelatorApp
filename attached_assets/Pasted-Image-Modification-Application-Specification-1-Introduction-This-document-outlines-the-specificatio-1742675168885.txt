Image Modification Application Specification
1. Introduction
This document outlines the specifications for an image modification application that allows users to apply various pixel art-style transformations to images using a Python backend and a user-friendly HTML/JS frontend. The application will enable users to upload images, select modification parameters such as color palette and quantization method, and download the resulting image.
2. Goals
Intuitive User Interface: The application should be easy to understand and use for individuals with varying levels of technical expertise.
Clear Workflow: The process of uploading, modifying, and downloading images should be straightforward and logical.
Real-time Preview (Optional but Recommended): If feasible, provide a preview of the modified image as the user adjusts parameters.
Robust Backend: The Python backend should efficiently process images and handle potential errors gracefully.
Maintainability: The codebase should be well-structured and easy to maintain and extend in the future.
3. Target Audience
Individuals interested in creating pixel art effects from regular images.
Hobbyists and enthusiasts of retro aesthetics.
Users who need to quickly convert images to a limited color palette for various purposes.
4. Functional Requirements
Image Upload:
Users should be able to upload image files (e.g., JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP) from their local storage.
The application should provide clear visual feedback upon successful upload.
There should be a mechanism to handle large file sizes (e.g., progress bar, size limits).
Parameter Selection:
Color Palette:
Users should be able to select from a list of color palettes 
These color palettes are stored as hex files in a specific directory.
Display the selected palette visually (swatches of colors).
Quantization Mode:
Users should be able to choose from the following quantization modes:
Contrast: (Based on quantize_with_edge_emphasis) - Emphasizes edges while quantizing.
Natural: (Based on quantize_to_palette_cielab) - Attempts a more natural color reduction using CIELAB color space.
K-Means: (Based on quantize_kmeans) - Uses k-means clustering to find dominant colors and then matches them to the palette.
K-Means (Brightness): (Based on quantize_kmeans_full) - Uses k-means and maps clusters to the palette based on brightness.
Provide a brief description or tooltip for each quantization mode to help users understand their differences.
Upscale Factor:
Users should be able to select an integer upscale factor (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, up to a reasonable limit like 20).
Clearly label this option as for "pixel art" upscaling.
Maximum Resolution: The user should be able to set the max_resolution parameter to define the maximum resolution of the output image resulting in the desired pixelated effect. The standard setting should be 512 x 512, other values should be offered as preselection (128 x 128, 256 x 256,..) and the user should be able to set their own resolution.
Image Modification Execution:
A clear "Apply" or "Convert" button should trigger the image modification process.
The application should provide visual feedback during processing (e.g., a loading indicator).
Result Display:
The modified image should be displayed prominently on the frontend after processing is complete.
Display the original image alongside the modified image for easy comparison (optional, but highly recommended).
Download:
Users should be able to download the modified image as a PNG file.
The download should be initiated by a clearly labeled "Download" button.
The downloaded filename should be informative (e.g., original_filename_quantizationmode_palettename_upscalefactor.png).
Error Handling:
The application should gracefully handle invalid file uploads (e.g., incorrect format, size exceeding limits).
Informative error messages should be displayed to the user in case of backend processing failures (e.g., palette file not found).
Clear Button: A button to clear the current image and reset parameters for a new modification.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Image processing should be reasonably fast for typical image sizes. The backend should be optimized for the chosen operations.
Usability: The application should be intuitive and easy to navigate. Users should be able to complete the image modification process without extensive instructions.
Responsiveness: The frontend should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet).
Scalability (Future Consideration): While not an immediate requirement, the backend architecture should ideally be designed with potential future scaling in mind.
Security: Basic security measures should be in place to prevent common web vulnerabilities (though this application likely has minimal security concerns given its nature).
6. User Interface (UI) Design
The UI should follow a clean and simple layout. Here's a potential structure:
Header: Application title ("Pixel Art Image Modifier").
Main Content Area:
Step 1: Upload Image:
A prominent "Choose File" button or a drag-and-drop area for image upload.
Display the name of the uploaded file.
A thumbnail preview of the uploaded image (optional, but helpful).
Step 2: Select Parameters:
Max resolution:
A dropdown with values like 64 x 64, 128 x 128, 256 x 256, 512 x 512 (preselected), 1024 x 1024
The option to define a custom resolution
Color Palette:
A dropdown or a visually presented list of available palettes as extracted from the folder containing the hex files.
Display color swatches for the selected palette.
An option to "Upload Custom Palette" (if this functionality is implemented) This option should allow for the palette to be named and saved as a hex file in the palette folder.
Quantization Mode:
A dropdown or a set of radio buttons for selecting the quantization mode.
Tooltips or brief descriptions for each mode (e.g., on hover).
Upscale Factor:
A dropdown or a number input field to select the upscale factor.
Label clearly (e.g., "Pixel Art Upscale Factor").
Step 3: Apply & View:
A large, clearly labeled "Apply" or "Convert" button.
A loading indicator (e.g., spinner) displayed during processing.
Result Area:
Display the modified image prominently.
Step 4: Download:
A prominent "Download" button below the modified image.
A "Clear" or "New Image" button to start over.
Footer: (Optional) Copyright information or links.
Key UI Principles:
Visual Hierarchy: Use clear headings, labels, and spacing to guide the user.
Consistency: Maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the application.
Feedback: Provide clear and timely feedback to the user on their actions (e.g., successful upload, processing status, errors).
Accessibility: Consider basic accessibility guidelines (e.g., alt text for images, keyboard navigation).
7. Backend Architecture
The backend will be built using Python and a web framework like Flask or Django.
The frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) will communicate with the backend via API calls (likely using RESTful principles).
When the user uploads an image and submits the parameters:
The frontend will send the image file and selected parameters to a backend API endpoint.
The backend will receive the image and parameters.
The backend will use the provided Python functions (downscale_image, enhance_contrast, quantize_to_palette_cielab, quantize_with_edge_emphasis, quantize_kmeans, quantize_kmeans_full, upscale_image) to process the image according to the selected parameters.
The backend will then send the processed image back to the frontend. This could be done by encoding the image as a base64 string or by providing a URL to the processed image.
The frontend will then display the received image to the user.
For downloading, the frontend can either download the image data received from the backend or request a download from a specific backend endpoint.
Palette files will be stored on the backend server in a designated directory.
